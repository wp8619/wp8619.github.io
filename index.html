                        <br><h1>Peng Wang</h1><br>

                        <p>Peng is a professor with School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). From July 2019 to April 2023, he was a lecturer (assistant professor) with School of Computing and Information Technology at University of Wollongong. Prior to joinging UOW, he was a research fellow with Auatralian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), The University of Adelaide.
                        He obtained his PhD from School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland.</p>
                        
            

                        <br><br>

                        <p>His research interests lie broadly in computer vision and machine learning. His current research focuses on learning in realistic scenarios, including but not limited to
                        long-tail learning, open-ended learning, and learning with limited human annotation.</p>
